So this is a random project i decided to do out of bordem and anger that there was no script to do this.  All this does is just installing all the files needed for modding the switch

You will need python3 installed and requests installed for python to run my script 

Keep in mind this is my first time making a script ever so theres bound to be errors inefficentes
